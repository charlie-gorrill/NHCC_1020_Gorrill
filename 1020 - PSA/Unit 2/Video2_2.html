    use this document to take notes.  You do not need any functioning markup on this page.  Things to take note of: What is semantics, why is semantics important for web design? are there any non-semantic tags in html?  What if a tag makes the contet look the way I want it to look, can I use that tag if it is not semantically correct?  Can I use the center tag?  Why or why not?
