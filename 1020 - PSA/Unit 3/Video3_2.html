<!--
    Paste the basic template into this file.  You need the following: header with h1, 3 articles each with h2 and 3 paragraphs, footer with a paragraph. You probably have this saved in your Templates module, copy/paste from there.  If you don't have that template yet, you will need to type it all out.  See a trend here?  We will be consistently reusing markup from previous videos so make templates.
    When you have a template in this file, style the webpage like I do in the video.  When you are done with the video take some time to play with the properties that we used, give them some different values and make the design your own.  
    This file will be a great template for the first assignment!
