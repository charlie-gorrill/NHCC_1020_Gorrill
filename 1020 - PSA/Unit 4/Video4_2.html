<!--Start by copying the markup from the last video into this file or type out a basic template.  
If you are still a bit uncomfortable with the HTML/CSS skills, I crcommend that you type it out.  Get the following: Header with H1, 3 articles each with an h2 at the top and 3 paragraphs, and a footer with a paragraph at the bottom of the page. Add a stylesheet and some styles. 
    Take note of absolute links and relative links.  Know the difference, be able to make both types.-->
    <!--In this video you will need some images.  I recommend that you search for a few images on Google and download them to your chromebook.  You can then upload them to Coding Rooms by using the upload button in the file browser on the left side of this IDE.  It will help to have a few images uploaded to this assignment before you start.-->
