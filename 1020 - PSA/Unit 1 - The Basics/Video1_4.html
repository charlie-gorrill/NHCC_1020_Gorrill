<!--Copy all markup from the video in this document.  You may use this markup as a template for future assignments.  I strongly recommend that you make a new html file in the Templates unit and copy/paste the finished markup in a file there.  Before making it a template, make sure that there are no errors.  Check with a classmate or your teacher to see that there are no errors.  Most html files for the next few units will uses this as a base.-->
