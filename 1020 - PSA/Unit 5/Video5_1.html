<!--Start with a template.  You may either type out our standard Unit 3 template or you may copy/paste from your Templates folder.  If you are still a bit uncomfortable with the HTML/CSS skills, I crcommend that you type it out.  Get the following: Header with H1, 3 articles each with an h2 at the top and 3 paragraphs, and a footer with a paragraph at the bottom of the page. Add a stylesheet and some styles. 
    Take note of absolute links and relative links.  Know the difference, be able to make both types.
