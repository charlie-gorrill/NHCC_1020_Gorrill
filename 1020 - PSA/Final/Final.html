<!--Use this same file for all of the videos in Unit 9.  Write all markup with the videos.  You will need images, a css reset, a color scheme etc.  You should have all resources that we have used at your disposal for these videos. <!--
    Read the requirements doc for the final project before starting this assignment.  You will make 5 html files and link them together.  You may use previous assignments for reference, but you must make a new template for your index page.  Once you make the index page, you may use that as a template for your other pages.
